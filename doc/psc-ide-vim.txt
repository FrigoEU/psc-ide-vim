COMPLETION                                      *purs-completion*
The plugin provides omni completion |i_CTRL-X_CTRL-O| for your PureScript
coding and user completion so you can complete with |i_CTRL-X_CTRL-U| too.
The 'omnifunc' is though to provide as thigh list of results as possible,
while the user completion is though to find as many results as possible.

Both completion function will work with qualified and unqualified
indentifiers.

Also many of the commands can be completed.

It will produce:
>
    concat :: forall a b. Show a => Show b => a -> b -> String
    concat _ _ = ?concat

 :Pcase[!] type
<Add case expression for give type, with optional |<bang>| it will also
include type annotations, e.g. starting with
>
    myCase :: Either String Int -> String
    myCase _ = ?s<  -- cursor over `_`

then using `:Pcase Either String Int` and will put
>
  myCase :: Either String Int -> String
  myCase (Left _) = ?s
  myCase (Right _) = ?s
<It also works over case expressions:
>
  myCase :: Either String Int -> String
  myCase a = case a of
    _ -> ?s -- cursor over `_`
<will result with
>
  myCase :: Either String Int -> String
  myCase a = case a of
    (Left _) -> ?s
    (Right _) -> ?s

<Import identifier. It might be qualified if you have qualified imports.  If
identifier is not given as an argument the word under the cursro is taken.
